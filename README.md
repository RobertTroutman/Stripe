Stripe Case Study

![](Stripe/stripe-logo.jpg)

## Overview and Origin:
* Stripe, Inc.
* Stripe was founded in 2010 by Patrick Collison and John Collison, two Irish-born brothers who both dropped out of Ivy League schools MIT and Harvard. The idea of came to them when they pondered why it was so difficult to accept payments over the web. Their plan was to make it really simple. Over the next 6 months they experimented with the idea and tinkered user friendly interfaces with friends, and studied their interactions along the way.
* Stripe originally sought out investers to build their idea and gain credibility, in their eyes they "didn't look great on paper." SO, they started to grow their idea through word of mouth through friends, which cought momentum since all other platforms were so difficult to use. The Collison brothers finally received investing from Paul Graham of Y Combinator. Paul beilieved this to be an easy decision from making money off Patrick's previous company. The next summer after gaining business insights from the founder of PayPal, they were able to raise $2 Million of investments. Jumping forward to August 2019 they have raised to $1.1 Billion, and valuated at $35 Billion!!!
* Most of their revenue is made through fees it charges to their customers. These fees due vary from which bundle of service customers use and also on payment volume. Their standard structure is 2.9% + 30Â¢ per successfully executed payement transaction.
